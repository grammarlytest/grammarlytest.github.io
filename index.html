		The Chicago Bears are off to a surprising 4-1 start, but their latest victory may have come at a high price. ESPN Radio 1000 in Chicago is reporting that Bears wide receiver Marcus Robinson suffered a torn ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after he injured the knee. The Bears did not disclose the severity of the injury after the game. The reported injury is a major blow for Robinson, who was coming off back surgery after missing the final four games of the 2000 season with a bulging disc. Robinson ranked second on the team with 23 catches for 269 yards and two touchdowns this season.
